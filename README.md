# MEAM 2480
As part of this lab, we created a trebuchet and tested it using a telemetry device to collect data. 

We then used this data to make a model predicting its trajectories. 
The competition on the final day tested the accuracy of our models with a challenge: launching a projectile into a hoop without touching the edge.
